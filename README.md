# gRPC Standard Methods Generator

This project is a Protobuf generator that automatically generates gRPC methods based on
the "[standard methods](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/standard_methods)" section of the Google API design guide.
The generated methods include List, Get, Create, Update, and Delete, which are commonly used in API design.

The generator works on top of the existing `protoc-gen-go`, `protoc-gen-go-grpc`, and `sqlc` tools. It utilizes the
files generated by these tools to generate the standard gRPC methods for your Go project. By following the Google API
design guide, this generator aims to promote consistency and best practices in API development.

## Features

- Generates gRPC service methods for List, Get, Create, Update, and Delete operations based on the resource messages
  defined in your Protobuf files.
- Follows the naming conventions and method signatures outlined in the Google API design guide.
- Support pagination

## Setup

We can install dependencies with:

```shell
go mod download
```

also, it's possible to use the `make`:

```shell
make install
```

and to run the code:

```shell
go cmd/main.go
```

## Build

To simply build the project a simple `make` command is enough, and then you could find the binary file in the `bin`
directory:

```shell
make
```

to see all the available commands, use `help` argument:

```shell
make help
```
